# Contributing to Construkt

Simple set of rules that will help you hit the ground running while
working/checking out this project.

## Versions, packages etc.

- Node 14.15.0+;
- npm 6.14.0+.

## Quick start

- Clone the respository;
- Run `npm install`;
- Check `package.json / scripts` to see what you want to run.

## Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and
pull requests for every feature. I strongly recommend [plugin for JetBrains
editors](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit). Every
PR will be checked with Codiga for best practices (linting, long
or complex functions, code repetitions etc.).
